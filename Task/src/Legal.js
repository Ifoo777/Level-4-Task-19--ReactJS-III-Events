            <h3>A Page for Disclaimers</h3>
            <p>
                A mere simplified variety of Terms & Conditions, Disclaimers are generally used on such sites that accept a massive quantity of user-submitted content or have a lot of external page links. If your website is one of them, it is essential for you to post disclaimers.<br/><br/>
                On top of that, it becomes more imperative if the content contributed on your website isn’t moderated or edited by anyone. Basically, it is all about informing the visitors that you, as the owners of the site, won’t be responsible for links or content available on the website.

                Not just that, but if you have some specific corporate policies and you want your users or visitors to get familiar with such policies, it would be recommended to create individual pages for them so that your visitors wouldn’t get confused.

                In certain countries, putting up a cookies policy page on the website is a necessity by the law. Although not every website creates an individual page for cookies policy and only adds it up in the page of privacy policy, however, it would be easier to bring it in the limelight by having a single different page.<br/><br/>
