# Level-4-Task-19--ReactJS-III-Events

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Create a navigation menu component for the website for the fictitious company you have been working on in the last tasks. 

This component should include menu items for the home page, user profile page, shopping page, and legal page.

● Modify the App.js file you created in your previous task to do the following:

○ Display the header component on every page.

○ Display the menu component on every page. The menu component should only display relevant items. For example, if the user is on the “shop” page, the “shop” menu item should no longer be displayed.

○ Only display the landing component on the home page (i.e. root URL - “/”)

○ Display at least 3 product components when the “shop” menu item is selected.

## Task 2

Create an interest calculator for the shopping website above. Add it as its own component and page with its own menu item and URL path.

The page should ask the user for their shopping total, and number of months over which they’d like to pay back said amount.

Use a non-compounding interest rate of 20% to calculate their monthly payments as well as the total they will have paid over all the months.
